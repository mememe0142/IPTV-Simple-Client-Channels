# IPTV-Simple-Client-Channels

Hello! This is my channel list for the IPTV Simple Client Addon.

IPTV also known as Internet Protocol Television. IPTV sends shows and movies through your internet connection. The minimum speed required for IPTV is 10Mbps and 2Mbps for uploading. But, if you don't want lag while watching IPTV, you must have an internet connection that can offer over 10Mpbs speeds.
